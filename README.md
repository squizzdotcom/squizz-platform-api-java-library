# SQUIZZ.com Platform API Java Library

The [SQUIZZ.com](https://www.squizz.com) Platform API Java Library can be used by Java applications to access the SQUIZZ.com platform's Application Programming Interface (API), allowing data to be pushed and pulled from the API's endpoints in a clean and elegant way. The kinds of data pushed and pulled from the API using the library can include organisational data such as products, sales orders, purchase orders, customer accounts, supplier accounts, notifications, and other data that the platform supports.

This library removes the need for Java software developers to write boilerplate code for connecting and accessing the platform's API, allowing Java software using the platform's API to be writen faster and simpler. The library provides classes and objects that can be directly referenced within a Java application, making it easy to manipulate data retreived from the platform, or create and send data to platform.

If you are a software developer writing a Java application then we recommend that you use this library instead of directly calling the platform's APIs, since it will simplify your development times and allow you to easily incorporate new functionality from the API by simplying updating this library.
